# Week 9 â€” CI/CD with CodePipeline, CodeBuild and CodeDeploy

### CI CD Piple Security Explained for AWS

**What is a CI/CD**
- CI : Continuous Integration
- CD : Continuous Deployment
- Deploy code into production many time without manually building and testing

What AWS services can help to achieve CI/CD
- CodeCommit
- CodeBuild
- CodeDeploy
- CodePipeline - CI/CD flow Orchestrator

you can use others Code Repo like GITLab, GITHub, BitBucket

**OWASP Top 10 CI/CD**
here the top ten CI/CD Security Risks
- CICD-SEC1 : Insufficient Flow Control Mechanims
- CICD-SEC2 : Inadequate Identity and Access Management
- CICD-SEC3 : Dependency Chanin Abuse
- CICD-SEC4 : Poisoned Pipeline Execution (PPE)
- CICD-SEC5 : Insufficient PBAC (Pipeline-Based Access Controls)
- CICD-SEC6 : Insufficient Credential Hygiene
- CICD-SEC7 : Insecure System Configuration
- CICD-SEC8 : Ungoverned Usage of 3rd Party Services
- CICD-SEC9 : Improper Artifact Integrity Validation
- CICD-SEC10: Insufficient Logging and Visibility

**Amazon Secrutiy Best Practices**

*AWS - Best Practices*
- Compliance standard is what your business requires from a CI/CD service and is available in the region you need to operate in
- Amazon Organizations SCP - to restrict actions like creation, deletion, modification of production CI/CD pipeline services etc
- AWS CloudTrail is enabled & monitored to trigger alerts for malicious activities e.g changes to Production CodePipeline, etc.
- GuardDuty is enabled for monitoring suspicious DNS comms(e.g Crypto-mining etc) and automated for auto-remediation
- AWS Config Rules is enabled in the account and region of CodeBuild  Performance pack for any other CI/CD service

*Application - Best Practices*
- Access control - Roles or IAM Users for making changes in Amazon CICD services especially production related repositories, pipeline, build services).
- Security of the CI/CD - source control, secret management, container registry, CI/CD service (if not the AWS Service), IAM etc
- Security in the CI/CD Pipeline - Code Security Best Practices - SCa, SAST, Secret Scanner, DAST implemented  in the CI/CD pipeline
- Security of the CI/CD Pipeline entry point e.g - no bypass of CI/CD to make prodcution changes
- Enable Encryption in Transit using TLS/SSL certification eg HTTPS
- Only use Trusted Source Control for sending changes to CI/CD pipeline
- Develop Process for continuously verifiying if there is a change that may compromise the know state of a CI/CD pipeline
